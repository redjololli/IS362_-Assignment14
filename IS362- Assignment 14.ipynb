    "The web site I picked to analyze is ShopGoodWill, online buying and selling web site to find that special item you have been looking for. Shopgoodwill.com offers a wide array of antiques and collectibles as well as new and nearly new items. Shopgoodwill.com is the first e-commerce auction platform created, owned, and operated by a nonprofit organization. The site was designed to provide an engaging online shopping destination that would further the Goodwill mission of putting people to work. Today, more than 110 Goodwill organizations from across the country list and auction unique items on the site, including art, antiques, collectibles, apparel, jewelry, electronics and more. All revenue from these auction sales fund Goodwill’s life-changing programs and services for people with disabilities and other barriers. More than $515 million in online sales have been generated on shopgoodwill.com since its launch in 1999. After carefully reviewing ShopGoodWill, I found that ShopGoodWill uses New Today, Last Chance, ending today, and “Buy It Now” system. However, I notice that ShopGoodWill does not use collaborative filtering, featured deals, most viewed items, Goodwill recommendations, most purchased and current fast bidding items recommenders’ systems which will encourage users to click on the deal and bid."
